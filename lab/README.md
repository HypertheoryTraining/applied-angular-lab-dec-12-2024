# Lab

## Getting Setup

## Options

You have several options for this lab time.

## Counter [Counter Lab Instructions](./counter.md)

Do the counter again.
I changed the lab so that you can do it again as a "feature", using feature flags.

## Inputs / Outputs

If you want to practice using signals, and inputs and outputs (like we covered on the first day), you
can follow (roughly) the video at [Applied Angular Inputs](https://applied-angular.hypertheory.com/docs/pre-work/02-components-inputs.html) and [Applied Angular Outputs](https://applied-angular.hypertheory.com/docs/pre-work/03-components-outputs.html)

> **Note**: In the video I put the code in a component called "home component". We already have that. Instead, create a feature folder called "news", create a route to "news" (like you did in the counter lab), and do everything in that folder. You can _optionally_ hide this behind a feature flag.

## Books [Books Lab](./books.md)

This one is a little more involved.
